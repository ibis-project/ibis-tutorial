Hello Ibis tutorial attendees!

We are excited to welcome you to the Ibis Tutorial at PyCon 2024!

The tutorial is on Wednesday, May 15th, at 1:30pm, in Room 319.

All of the tutorial materials are available at  https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-tutorial/

## Setup instructions

### Using GitHub Codespace

We have designed this tutorial to be run within Jupyter notebooks inside a
GitHub Codespace.  If you do not have a GitHub account, please create one before
the tutorial (https://github.com/join).

Other than that, just bring yourself and a laptop with a web browser and
everything else should be good to go!

### Running locally

If you would prefer to run the tutorial directly on your laptop, we have a few
requests and disclaimers.

1. We cannot provide installation support during the tutorial (sorry!).  We're
   happy to help troubleshoot outside of teaching time, but we can't stop the
   lesson to fight with Python environments.

2. Please install Ibis _before_ the tutorial -- we're going to make use of
   several dependencies and depending on the state of the conference wifi, it
   may take a while to install.
   
   We have provided environment files for Pixi (`pixi.toml`), Conda
   (`environment.yml`), and pip (`requirements.txt`).

3. Please clone the tutorial repository and then run the `local_setup.py` script
   in the root of the tutorial repository _before_ the tutorial.  It will
   download all of the necessary datasets for the tutorial. (Make sure to re-run
   `git pull` before we start the tutorial so you get all of our last-minute
   changes.)
   
   
We'll see you all on Wednesday!
Gil, Phillip, Naty, and Jim
