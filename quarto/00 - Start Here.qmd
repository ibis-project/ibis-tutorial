# Welcome to the Ibis tutorial!

On the left ðŸ‘ˆ there is a file browser open with the tutorial notebooks.

For convenience they're also linked below ðŸ‘‡

1. [Getting Started](./01%20-%20Getting%20Started.ipynb)
1. [Memtables, Joins, and Selectors](./02%20-%20Memtables,%20Joins,%20and%20Selectors.ipynb)
1. [Playing with PyPI](./03%20-%20Playing%20with%20PyPI.ipynb)


First, let's kick off a download of some PyPI maintainer data, we'll use this later on.

```{python}
import urllib.request
from pathlib import Path

## Download PyPI maintainer data from Ibis Tutorial bucket

filenames = [
    "deps.parquet",
    "maintainers.parquet",
    "package_urls.parquet",
    "packages.parquet",
    "scorecard_checks.parquet",
    "wheels.parquet",
]

folder = Path("pypi")
folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

for filename in filenames:
    path = folder / filename
    if not path.exists():
        print(f"Downloading {filename} to {path}")
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(
            f"https://storage.googleapis.com/ibis-tutorial-data/pypi/2024-04-24/{filename}",
            path,
        )
```

Let's continue by loading some IMDB ratings data into a local PostgreSQL database!
We will do this using DuckDB, yes you can do that!

```{python}
!psql < demo/create_imdb.sql
!duckdb < load_imdb.sql
```

And we'll confirm that our PostgreSQL database contains the tables we just loaded.

```{python}
!psql << '\dt'
!psql < verify.sql
```
