Let's kick things off by loading some PyPI package data into a local PostgreSQL database!


```{python}
import duckdb

tables = [
    "deps",
    "maintainers",
    "package_urls",
    "packages",
    "scorecard_checks",
    "wheels",
]

stmts = ["ATTACH 'dbname=postgres user=postgres' AS pycon2024 (TYPE POSTGRES)"]

for table in tables:
    url = f"https://storage.googleapis.com/ibis-tutorial-data/pypi/2024-04-24/{table}.parquet"
    stmts.append(f"CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE pycon2024.{table} AS FROM '{url}'")

duckdb.execute("; ".join(stmts))
```
