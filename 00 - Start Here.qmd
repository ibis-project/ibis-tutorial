Let's kick things off by loading some PyPI package data into a local PostgreSQL database!
We will do this using DuckDB, yes you can do that! 

```{python}
!duckdb < load_pypi.sql
!psql < demo/create_imdb.sql
!duckdb < demo/load_imdb.sql
```

And we'll confirm that our PostgreSQL database contains the tables we just loaded.

```{python}
!psql << '\dt'
!psql < verify.sql
```
