# Welcome to the Ibis tutorial!

On the left ðŸ‘ˆ there is a file browser open with the tutorial notebooks.

For convenience they're also linked below ðŸ‘‡

1. [Getting Started](./01%20-%20Getting%20Started.ipynb)
1. [Memtables, Joins, and Selectors](./02%20-%20Memtables,%20Joins,%20and%20Selectors.ipynb)
1. [Playing with PyPI](./03%20-%20Playing%20with%20PyPI.ipynb)

Let's kick things off by loading some PyPI package data into a local PostgreSQL database!

```{python}
!duckdb < load.sql
```

And we'll confirm that our PostgreSQL database contains the tables we just loaded.

```{python}
!psql <<< '\dt'
!psql < verify.sql
```
